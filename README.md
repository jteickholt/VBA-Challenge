This repository contains my completed homework for week2 (VBA-Challenge)

1.  The folder VBA-Challenge 1 contains the vba code to do the calculations and display the results for just the active worksheet.  The folder also contains the screenshots of the results for each year within the PowerPoint (each year has a different slide).

2.  The folder VBA-Challeng 2 contains the vba code that will do the calculations and display the results for all worksheets. The folder also contains the screenshots of the results for each year within the PowerPoint (each year has a different slide).
